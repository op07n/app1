# This is just a simplest possible streamlit app, hosted on Heroku. 

# How to use ?

clone the project, go to heroku and start a new app. select your git repo and deploy. It should start in few seconds with a welcome message.


# Note :

My requirements.txt is way bigger than it should be, because I am using a pre existing conda env. you can trim it to your needs.
